# Project 2: Check password

In this project we will write a program that determines whether a password is strong enough
according to several security rules.

This entire project is to be written using pure Python (no external libraries).

# Project requirements
#### 1. A good password must:
- Be at least 8 characters long and at most 64 characters.
- Contain at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one digit, and one special
character (special characters are any of: !@#$%ˆ&*()-_+=[]{};:’",<.>/?\|‘ .
- Not contain any spaces.
  
#### 2. For additional complexity:
- Reject passwords that are entirely alphabetic or entirely numeric.
- Reject passwords that contain 3 or more identical consecutive characters (e.g., aaa,
111).
- Reject passwords that are among a small list of commonly used insecure passwords
such as: "password", "123456", "qwerty", "letmein".
